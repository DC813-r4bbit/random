# About
  Code slung by: r4bbit
    Requested by a member in the 'Info Share' group on Signal.

# Description
  A simple bash script to resolve IPs from hostnames listed in a file.
  
# How to use
  Pretty straight forward...
    1. Clone the repo
    2. cd into the host2ip directory
    3. Modify the 'hostnames.txt' file to suite your needs
    4. Run ./host2ip.sh
    
  The output includes a tab in each line between the hostname and resolved IP so you can copy/paste into csv, excel, etc.
  You can also run "./host2ip.sh > resolved.txt" (minus quotes) to write the output to a file.
